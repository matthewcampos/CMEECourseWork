#####Shell script:
* ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh- merges files
* MyExampleScript.sh- prints User name by assigning to a variable

#####LaTex
* FirstExample.sh- script of practice LaTex to pdf file
* FirstBiblio.bib- bibliography example
* CompileLaTex.sh- program to convert LaTex to pdf for any file
* FirstExample.bbl
* FirstExample.blg
* FirstExample.pdf- PDF of FirstExample script
#####Unix
* UnixPrac1.txt- first practical which analyses three files from Data directory

**Data**- this directory consists of the data used to run those in Code
* 1800.csv
* 1801.csv
* 1802.csv
* 1803.csv
* 407228326.fasta.txt
* 407228412.fasta.txt
* E.coli.fasta.txt
* Results- where csv to space separated files are stored
    * 1800_space.txt
    * 1801_space.txt
    * 1802_space.txt
    * 1803_space.txt
