# README Week 2
<ul>The week focused on learning and understanding Python

##Directory
**Code**
* basic_io1.py- opens test.txt from Sandbox and prints out the text using for loop
* basic_io2.py- retrieves strings from test.txt and saves them to a list
* basic_io3.py- creates a separate file, testp.p, of a dictionary using pickle
* basic_csv.py- collects data from testcsv.csv and prints it out a tuple using for loop, and writes a new file, bodymass.csv
* loops.py- practice understanding for loops
* cfexercises2.py- understand how to combine loops and conditionals
* oaks.py- utilising conditionals and prints them using loops and comprehensions
* scope.py- understand how global variables work
* boilerplate.py- basic program that prints a string. Intended to understand the format and syntax of programs
* using_name.py- takes lines from boilerplate.py and used to comprehend the purpose of name==main
* sys.argv.py- understanding the purpose of argv
* control_flow.py- program that consists of functions that determines prime numbers, and takes arguments to print result
* test_control_flow.py- practice using doctest
* debugme.py- function that has a bug (cannot divide by 0)

Practicals:
* lc1.py- first practical that requires using loops and comprehensions to retrieve data from an array
* lc2.py- also practice with loops and comprehensions
* dictionary.py- practice writing a script to populate a dictionary
* tuple.py- script to extract data from a tuple
* cfexercises1.py- different functions that utilise if and while statements that is modularised
* align_seqs.py- practical that opens a csv file and finds the best alignment and saves it in a separate file (best_sequence.txt in Results directory)
* align_seqs_fasta.py- extra credit that takes the fasta sequences from Week1 and aligns them. Saves in Results directory
* align_seqs_better.py- extra extra credit that saves all the best alignments rather than just one. Saves in Results directory
* oaks_debugme.py- practice with debugging and fixing code

**Data**
* testcsv.csv
* sequences.csv
* TestOaksData.csv
* JustOaksData.csv
* bodymass.csv

**Results**
* best_sequence.txt
* best_fasta_sequence.txt
* better_sequence.txt

**Sandbox**
