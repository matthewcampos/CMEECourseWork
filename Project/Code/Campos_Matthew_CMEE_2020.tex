\section{Declaration}
All raw data collected were from the simulation I created for my project. The simulation requires the input of genetic model systems, and mathematical equations used to derive output. The model system and equations used in the simulation were sourced from the work of \textit{Omholt et al,} and \textit{Gjuvsland et al}. I was reponsible for data processing, cleaning and analysis. All analyses presented in the paper are from the simulations, with the help of my supervisor.

\section{Acknowledgements}
I would like to firstly thank Dr. Scott Rifkin for being a wonderful supervisor and guiding me throughout the project. This includes understanding background knowledge, results and overall research purposes. Secondly, thank you to Dr. Thomas Bell for agreeing to be my internal supervisor, making sure I am aware of the process of the project and ensuring my safety during such difficult times. Also to Dr. Samraat Pawar and Dr. James Rosindell for co-leading a challenging but rewarding CMEE course.
\\Finally I would like to thank the laboratory of Dr. Rifkin- Antonia Darragh, Jessica Bloom, Alexis Cugini, Yang Bing and Rachel Goodridge for being very welcoming and having wonderful and insightful weekly meetings. Good luck with everything!

\section{Permuations of Conditions}
\textbf{Description:} The different combinations of conditions used for data sorting and simulations. Data folders are permutations of Genetic structure and Environmental distance i.e. Same and 30 (Main population 50 and Migrant population 80). Within each folder are 44 combinations of starting genetic makeup of populations, migration rate and migration pattern for the simulations. For example, within Same and 30 is: homogenous - heterogenous, 3%, every generation.
