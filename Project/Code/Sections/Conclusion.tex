In just a few centuries, anthropogenic changes largely due to societal development has disrupted many habitats and altered the evolutionary path of many species, all of which is likely to have long-term ecological consequences. This study aimed to investigate the scenario where gene flow allows related species, that could have originally been reproductively isolated, to interbreed, and the long-term impacts on species morphology and development. This can give insight into possible patterns that could emerge with future novel interactions between species to understand how development of both phenotype and genotype are altered. Although results did reveal an effect of migratory patterns on the evolution of a species network, further studies must be conducted to truly observe the interactions of environmental forces and the interplay between molecular genetic mechanisms and macro evolutionary processes. Improvement to the current simulation design and repeated trials can contribute to such studies.
