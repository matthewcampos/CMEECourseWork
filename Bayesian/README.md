# Statistical Inference

Introduction to probability and statistics for MSc Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology and MSc Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution at Imperial College London.

This repository includes all quantitative material taught by Matteo Fumagalli in a series of jupyter notebooks for the following courses: Bayesian statistics (MSc CMEE, SP), Mathematics and Statistics module (MSc Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology, SK).

The relevant notebooks can be found in the ```Notebooks``` folder and ```Bayesian`` or ``Math`` subfolders with the following names and order:

#### Bayesian statistics (MSc CMEE, SP)

- B_01a.thinking.ipynb
- B_01b.concepts.ipynb
- B_01c.genomics.ipynb ^
- B_02a.priors.ipynb
- B_02b.inference.ipynb
- B_02c.population.ipynb ^ 
- B_03.computation.ipynb
- B_04a.abc.ipynb
- B_04b.speciation.ipynb ^
- B_05a.networks.ipynb
- B_5b.ecological_applications.ipynb ^

^ indicates practicals.

Complete, fully run and rendered pdf of notebooks for practicals should be merged into a single pdf. The latter should be uploaded in the appropriate folder on blackboard.
Deadline for submitting the file is 1 hour before the final course exam.

#### Mathematics and Statistics (MSc Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology, SK)

- M_01.probability.ipynb
- M_02.inference.ipynb (use Slides)
- M_03.bayesian.ipynb (can use Slides)
- M_04.learning.ipynb (use Slides)

This material should be used only by students from the aforementioned courses.
These notes and slides have been mostly based on "Statistical Inference", Casella & Berger, 2nd Ed.; "Bayesian methods for Data Analysis", Carlin & Louis, 3rd Ed.; taught material from Professor M Stumpf; "Probabilistic graphical models", Koeller and Friedman.

## Instructions

You should (for SP students) or may (for SK students) use your laptop during lectures.

To clone the repository on your machine:
```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mfumagal/statistical_inference
```
I suggest you make a fresh local copy that you can edit. 

Follow instructions [here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) to install the R kernel for jupyter notebooks and [here](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to install RISE (if you wish so).
The following R packages are required: abc, coda, maps, spam, fields.

To open a notebook, type
```
jupyter-notebook
```
The first time you open a notebook, make sure you have a "clean" version by clicking on "restart and clear output" under the "Kernel" option.

Guidance on typing using markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Likewise, a good source for latex formatting of mathematical objects is [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

## Slides

Slides for Math module at SK can be found in ```Slides/Math``` and are called ```main.pdf``` in each folder.
We may use jupyter-notebooks instead of slides during lectures.

## Readings

A self assessment document and additional papers for Bayesian statistics at SP can be found in the ```Readings``` folder.

## Solutions

Solutions of practicals for Bayesian statistics are encrypted and will be decrypted only after the dealine for submission.
