# README Computing Miniproject
<ul> code and notes for miniproject

##Directory
**Code**
* equations.R - contains all growth model function equations to be fitted to data
* LogisticPopulationGrowth.R - wrangles the data and makes it neat by eliminating outliers, as well as making unique Species ID
* Modelling.R - full script including function and commands in LogisticPopulationGrowth.R but also produces vector of parameters for model fitting as well as models

**Data**
* Genomesize.csv - practice with model fitting
* LogisticGrowthData.csv - data for miniproject
* LogisticGrowthMetaData.csv

**Results**
* SpeciesID.pdf - pdf containing plotted points of data for each unique Species ID
* CSV - folder containing saved data for each unique Species ID

**Readings and Lecture**
* Pawar_LinMods.pdf
* Pawar_ModelFitting.pdf
* Pawar_NLLS.pdf
* * Model selection.pdf
* STRATEGY OF MODEL BUILDING IN POPULATION BIOLOGY.pdf

**Sandbox**
* ModelFitting.R
